# Rails Generators

## Objectives

1. Identify the different generators available and their purpose
2. Generate migrations
3. Generate models
4. Generate controllers
5. Generate resources


## Notes

The rails gem comes with a handy CLI rails that we've already been using to generate a new application skeleton, start a server, and start a console.

let's look at what else it can do.

generators
from within a rails app

rails generate
migrations
models
controllers
resources
cover the magic route resources but we'll cover that more in depth later.
choose the smallest generate that provides you with the files you need, don't over generate, the less code in your app the better. never use scaffolds, it's too much code, learn the pattern and generate a resource.

Don't cover scaffolds in this...
